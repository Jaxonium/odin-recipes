        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Without referencing any grievances about the state of ground beef, 
            the key to a perfect cheeseburger comes straight from the butcher. 
            We got ours courtesy of Dickson’s Farmstand Meats, and boy was it 
            beautiful to behold. Neither slimy nor pink, this natural, humanely 
            raised and yet not grass-fed coarsely ground chuck was a fresh, bright 
            glossy red, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Or maybe Jess just 
            really loves raw meat, as demonstrated in our forthcoming 
            “How to Shape Burger Patties.”

            The All-American Cheeseburger has certain non-negotiable elements: 
            American cheese is one of them. Rather than unwrap individual singles, 
            get sliced cheese from your nearest deli counter — it tastes better and 
            melts slower and more evenly. Dill pickle chips, sliced red onion and 
            tomato, crisp lettuce leaves, ketchup and mayo are also involved. You 
            can mix even the two condiments together along with some chopped pickles 
            for Thousand Island dressing, a burger favorite, and it'll still be an 
            All-American Cheeseburger worth Instagramming.
